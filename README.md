# CCA
## CCA from scratch using numpy.

## REQIUREMENTS:
#### 1.openCV
#### 2.NumPY

## ALGORITHM:
#### 1.THRESHOLD THE IMAGE WHITE PIXELS OBJECTS AND BLACK BACKGROUND.
#### 2.START ASSIGNING PIXEL VALUES (FROM TO 1 TO NO. OF OBJECTS TO WHITE PIXELS) TO THE IT'S 8 NEIGHBOURHOOD POINTS I.E. 3X3 MATRIX TILL NO NEIGHBOURHOOD WHITE PIXEL LEFT.
#### 3.THEN INCREAMENT PIXEL VALUE FOR ANOTHER OBJECT BY 1.
#### 4.APPLY MEADIAN BLUR TO REMOVE ANOTHER OBJECT PIXEL NOISE.
#### 5.AFTER THAT CREATE 3 MATRIX (uint8) ONE WILL HOLD HUE VALUES FOR DIFFERENT OBJECTS AND OTHER TWO WITH MAX SATURATION AND VALUE/INTENSITY.
#### 6.NOW MERGE THEM TO MAKE A HSV IMAGE AND CONVERT IT TO BGR AND ONE MORE OPERATION TO MAKE 0 VALUE PIXEL IN HUE TO BLACK IN BGR FOR BACKGROUND.
